# Digit-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
Classification of the digits from the MNIST dataset using neural networks which are built from scratch
There are 2 versions which I have developed.
The first version is using a basic quadratic cost function.
The second version is a developed version with a cross entropy cost fuction, using evaluation data and Regularization techniques as well.
