# Digit-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
Classification of the digits from the MNIST dataset using neural networks which are built from scratch
There are 4 versions which I have developed.
The first version is using a basic quadratic cost function.
The second version is a developed version with a cross entropy cost fuction, using evaluation data and Regularization techniques as well.
The third version is an implementation of Neural networks using softmax cost function using tensorflow
The fourth version is an implementation of Convolutional Neural networks using tensorflow
